Downloading a bunch of youtube videos. Next I'll see if I can't go through and pick out six goals from one of them. Not sure how I should pick the non-goals to compare against.

Decided to just do a few non-goals scattered throughout. So that the comparison is fair, I should do the time that the ball is kicked. I can't really do the time that the ball crosses the line, since that never happens for non-goals.

Going to ignore chances and goals from set pieces, since I don't like them (and that seems like a different skill anyways).

Trying to get twice as many no-goals as goals, since more data is better and those are easier to find.

I'd like to have 20 questions, so I'll have to find 20 goals. That's definitely good enough for an MVP. I can switch to looking through highlights as well, which might be easier.


Need to show two videos side-by-side. There's a button beneath to say that it's a goal. We need to keep track of how many you got correct. When you pick your answer, it should show if you got it right, and you can watch the video forward.

I'll have to add a seeding to the random so that different people can take the same quiz.
